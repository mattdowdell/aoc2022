# Advent of Code 2022

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Each day's puzzle is its own
crate and has both the sample and user-specific inputs within.

## Usage

To run a given day's solution, use `cargo run` and pass the input file in using STDIN:

```sh
# run day 1's solution with the sample inputs
cargo run --bin day1 < day1/sample.txt

# run day 2's solution with the user-specific inputs
cargo run --bin day2 < day2/input.txt
```
